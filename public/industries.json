Quality issues like packaging defects, contaminants, and seal integrity failures must be addressed in real-time to uphold strict industry standards and avoid costly losses. Manual quality inspections across multiple product lines introduced human error, often resulting in inconsistencies and missed defects. Additionally, performing these inspections required extensive training for large inspection teams. In various food sectors, quality checks involve detecting specific defects for example, in confectioneries, inspecting for over baked or burnt items, in raw food, ensuring proper cooking, and in packed foods, verifying complete and secure packaging. For fruits and vegetables, color based object detection helps identify ripeness, while inspections for baby food, like cookies, require in-depth surface-level checks and the detection of any non-edible materials through non-destructive inspection methods. These challenges underscored the need for an automated, precise, and reliable quality inspection system.",
